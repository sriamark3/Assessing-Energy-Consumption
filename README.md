Assessing of Households Energy Consumption 
 
 Recognizing the Climate crisis by assessing and forecasting energy consumption in tackling this crisis, where the purpose of the project is to study, focuses on household energy forecasting to facilitate efficient resource planning and sustainability promotion. By dissecting the variables that influence energy usage, In future,we aim to create predictive models that will support financial management and individual decision making, as well as developing energy companies and will help the government in creation of public policy. In a way the findings of the perspective helps families. This leads to creativity and flexibility in the energy sector and helps the policymakers in developing plans for sustainable energy infrastructure. In conclusion, this study adds to the group effort towards a more robust and sustainable energy future, promoting stability in the economy, protection of the environment, and increased energy security on a local and global level. The dataset contains Households with respect to Houses and Energy consumption among them, covering each of them covering each of them i was able to implement the model development.

- Demonstrated the process that goes from raw data to processed data to the creation of a model.
- Developed a regression model that can forecast KWH values using a variety of available continuous and categorical data.
